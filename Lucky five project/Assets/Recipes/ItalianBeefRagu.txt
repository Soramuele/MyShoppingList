Finely chop equal amounts of carrot, white onion and celery. To make Italian beef ragu, I use 1 carrot, 1 celery stick and 1 white onion.
Saute the chopped veggies in a large pan with a little olive oil. The key is to saute the veg slowly on a low/medium heat so they soften and release all the delicious flavours without browning or burning (around 7-8 minutes).

Once the vegetables are soft add the ground beef and/or pork (mince) to the pan and brown then add the red wine and continue to cook until the wine has reduced by half.

Once the wine has reduced add the tomato sauce. Stir the sauce and let it simmer on a low heat for 2 and a half hours topping up with water as it reduces.
<b>Tip:</b> Remeber to check on the ragu every now and then to stir it and add extra stock or water if needed.
